A Guide to Cryptography. (Jupyter Notebook)

Created by myself: Lootii Kiri

Special Thanks:
Carlisle Adams – Designer of the CAST block cipher and my cryptography Professor at the University of Ottawa, whose lectures inspired this guide.
William Stallings – Reference to "Cryptography and Network Security" (7th Edition).
Various YouTube resources including : Neso Academy and "Introduction to Cryptography by Christof Paar". 

This Jupyter Notebook is a comprehensive guide to cryptography concepts, ranging from classical techniques to modern encryption systems. This includes some mathematical ideologies applied in cryptography. It covers essential theories, algorithms, and mechanisms used to secure communication and protect data integrity. This resource is designed for students, researchers, and anyone interested in understanding the fundamentals of cryptography. 

I have not finalized it and therefore this is still subject to change as I continue to learn more and expand my knowledge as well. 

I hope this simplifies your studies in the field! Enjoy.
